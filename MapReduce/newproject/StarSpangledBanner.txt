O say can you see by the dawn's early light,

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes.

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion. 

O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation.
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land.
